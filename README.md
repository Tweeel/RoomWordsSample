# RoomWordsSample
the app use the Android Architecture Components. The app, called RoomWordsSample, stores a list of words in a Room database and displays the list in a RecyclerView. The RoomWordsSample app is basic, but sufficiently complete that you can use it as a template to build on.

The RoomWordsSample app does the following:

Works with a database to get and save words, and pre-populates the database with some words.
Displays all the words in a RecyclerView in MainActivity.
Opens a second Activity when the user taps the + FAB button. When the user enters a word, the app adds the word to the database and then the list updates automatically.
The screenshots below show the following:
